# MLAlgortihmScratchImplementation
This repository contains from-scratch implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms using Python and NumPy.
The goal of this project is learning and understanding ML fundamentals, not building a production-ready application.

Instead of relying on libraries like scikit-learn, each algorithm is implemented step by step to understand the math, logic, and intuition behind how models learn.
